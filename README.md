# My Stock Market Notes

These notes are all taken from my learning throughout taking the courses in The Real World.
To take full advantage of these notes, you should have access to the course materials. I am 
not sponsored by The Real World, nor do I have any affiliation with them. I am just a student
who has taken the courses and needed a place to store them. However, I recommend the courses
with my full support, TRW has changed my life. To sign up, visit 
[The Real World](https://therealworld.net).

## How To Use This Repository

This repository contains all of my notes from each of the courses. There are two main sections
that were taught by a different Professor. They will be labeled as [Stocks](#) and [Crypto](#).
However, the lessons in the crypto section (for the most part) will apply to tradition stock 
market trading.

#### Professors 

The stocks section was taught by **Professor Aayush** who has now retired (as of Jan 2, 2025).
The crypto section was taught by **Professor Michael** who is still teaching in The Real World.


#### Layout

Each section will contain a `README.md` file that will contain a table of contents for the notes
as well as a brief overview of each lesson. This file will also help you to navigate through the 
lesson notes in the order in which they are expected to be learned.

Each lesson will have its own folder that will contain
another `README.md` file for each lesson. The lesson `README.md` file will contain the notes for
that lesson.

#### Quizzes 

Finally, the quizzes section will contain a `README.md` file that will contain a handful of 
questions that will test your knowledge of the material. I did not create these, they were also
apart of the course work in TRW. The answers will be in a separate file (`answers.md`) for you to 
review as you need. **REMEMBER!** Cheating only hurts yourself, this information is meant to teach 
you, not to help you cheat your way through the course.

The quizzes can be accessed at any point, but the lesson notes will indicate when you should take
each one. Following this course out of order may result in confusion and a lack of understanding.
Follow the instructions and you will be successful!
