# Leverage

#### Terms

**Collateral:** Asserts that act as a form of sectary to cover potential losses.

**Margin:** Amount of collateral that you must hold to cover potential losses.

**Initial Margin (Cost):** Amount of collateral required to open a position in perpetual
futures trading.

**Maintenance Margin (MMR):** The minimum amount of collateral you must hold to keep a position 
open. Differs from exchange to exchange, as well as coin to coin.

**Notional Size (Value):** The total $ value of your position. Notional Size ($) = Number of 
coins **x** current price of 1 coin. Changes in real time.

**When losses exceed maintenance margin, you will be liquidated.**

**MMR is a % of the Notional size of your position.**

**Leverage:** The amount you need to borrow from the exchange **AFTER** you known your entry,
stop loss, and notional position size.

***Leverage Comes Last.*** Doesn't matter how much leverage you use, it matters how much money 
you risk on  each trade. If you have $1000 and want to risk 1%, your stop loss should be set 
to lose $10, regardless of leverage. Leverage required will be different for each trade.

**Position Size Calculation:** Risk ($) / Entry - Stop Loss

e.g. You want to risk $10 (1% of portfolio) on an ATOM Long trade. Entry = $10.60 & Stop Loss = 
$10.10. So... **$10 / $0.50 = 20 ATOM**. Notional = 20 ATOM x 10.60 = $212. Leverage is the amount
you need to borrow from the exchange to open a $212 position.
