# Technical Analysis

## Trending vs. Mean Reverting

**Trending:** A market that is moving in a clear direction, either up or down. We know all about
this one. Higher highs and lows for an uptrend, and lower lows and highs for a down trend.

**Mean Reversion:** A market that is moving sideways, this can be indicated by a trend that 
touches the recent high/low. When a dump or pump occurs, and the price returns to the place it 
dumped/pumped from, this indicates a mean reverting market. This can also be called chop or 
ranging. This is very similar to trading ranges. The market spends more time in a mean reverting 
state than a trending state.

### Trading These Markets

**Trending:** In a trending market, you should be looking for pullbacks to enter a trade. Buy dips
and sell bounces. Shallow pullbacks are a good entry point to ride the next leg of the trend. Exit
when the trend is over and when mean reversion begins.

**Mean Reverting:** In a mean reverting market, you should be looking for the top and bottom of 
the range. Buy the range low and sell the range high. **DO NOT** buy dips and sell bounces, this
is a recipe for disaster. Repeat until failure. When the trend breaks you will be wrong, but it 
indicates that you can now being trading a trending market.

### Trends

**Uptrend:** A series of *impulses* up and small *corrections* down. Corrections meet resistance
and the trend continues.

**Downtrend:** A series of *impulses* down and small *corrections* up. Corrections meet resistance
and the trend continues.

**Impulses:** A violent move in the direction of the trend.

**Corrections:** A small move against the trend, similar to a pullback or retracement. Should find
resistance at the previous high/low.

### Ranges

The market spends **70 to 80 percent** of the time in a range. The path of least resistance is fixed,
and the direction is always changing. **Fakeouts** are common in a range, and the market will often
breakout and then return to the range. This is why it is important to wait for confirmation before
entry. This creates a **flat channel**.

Trading inside a range offers MUCH better risk:reward than trading a breakout.
