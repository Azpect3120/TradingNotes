# Market Structure

Where trends end, where new trends begin, and how to identify the best entry & exit points.

Two major theories **Wyckoff Theory** and **Dow Theory**. Wyckoff Theory is best used on a 
larger time frame and describes the market in four phases: Accumulation, Markup, Distribution,
and Markdown. Dow Theory is more basic and describes that higher highs and higher lows define a 
uptrend, and lower highs and lower lows define a downtrend. Both theories explain the market to 
be **fractal** in nature, meaning that the same patterns can be found on all time frames.

They key to note is: On smaller time frames price can move *"randomly"* but on larger time frames
price always moves with intent.

## The Dow Theory

#### Break of Structure (BOS)

**Trend Continuation** in both uptrends and downtrends.

This occurs after a correction takes place and price breaks the previous high/low. This is a sign
that the trend is continuing and that the correction is over. The **confirmation** of a BOS is 
when price **closes** above/below the previous high/low. Wicks DO NOT count! Since a close above 
or below did not occur.

```
e.g.
In an uptrend, price impulses up (A), corrects downward (B), and then impulses up again (C). 
When the price closes above the previous high (A), this is a confirmed BOS and the trend is 
expected to continue.
```

These rules apply for both uptrends and downtrends.


#### Market Structure Break (MSB)

This is also known as **Change of Character (CHOCH)**

**Trend Reversal** in both uptrends and downtrends.

This occurs during a correction when price breaks the previous low/high. This is a sign that the 
price is reversing and the trend is over. The **confirmation** of a MSB is when price **closes**
below/above the previous low/high. Wicks DO NOT count! Since a close below or above did not occur.

```
e.g.
In an uptrend, price impulses up (A), corrects downward (B), another impulse follows (C), and 
finally a correction (D) takes place. However, the final correction (D) breaks the previous 
low (B) and closes. This is a confirmed MSB and the trend is expected to reverse or enter into 
mean reversion.
```

These rules apply for both uptrends and downtrends.

## Trend Shifts

A market structure shift always occurs after an MSB/CHOCH. This is ALWAYS measured using candle 
closes. If you do not wait for a candle close, you are not waiting for confirmation and you may
see a false break or a sweep of liquidity.

Using a line chart instead of a candle chart can help you identify the trend shift more easily,
because it removes the noise of the wicks and only shows the closes.

### Swings

A **swing** is the entire wave between two BOS'. In an uptrend, this is any price action after 
the  high and until the high is broken, and vise versa. Only a swing high or low can cause a 
MSB/CHOCH.

**Swing High:** The highest point in a swing that does not break structure.

**Swing Low:** The lowest point in a swing that does not break structure.

**Interim High/Low:** Any other lows or highs made in between two BOS'.

The best way to trade these is to look back. Each time an MSB occurs, go back and mark all the 
swing highs and lows. Also mark any interim highs and lows.

The only time we can confirm a trend shift is when price breaks the previous swing high/low.

**IMPORTANT:** EVERY trend shift begins with an MSB/CHOCH, but not every MSB/CHOCH results in a
trend shift. **MSB's CAN FAIL!**

These failed MSB's are far more common on lower time frames. They are quite rare on higher time 
frames. This is because it is very easy for *smart money* to force price into a false breakout 
and trigger stops of the day traders and then reverse back into the trend.

## Reversals

### Head and Shoulders

A traditional head and shoulders pattern is great, but its not perfect. The under and over patterns
are stronger because they contain an *all important* **market structure break.** This takes place
when the neckline breaks before the right shoulder is formed, allowing us to enter at a better price.

### Under/over (Bullish Reversal)

This reason this works is due to psychology. After creating a level, it drops below and then prompty 
returns to the zone, trapping traders. After this bear trap, the price closes ABOVE the MSB which 
indicates that a high probability trend reversal is coming. The price then retests the level which
serves as confirmation of the trend reversal.

### Over/under (Bearing Reversal)

As the name suggests, we trape traders **above** the zone, and then move **under** to create the MSB.
Exactly the same as the previous under/over pattern, just inversed. One key fact to note is that 
the left shoulder restest (the 4th leg) does not always occur, and is not always perfect. The touch
will not be perfectly at the zone, it may be over or under. 

**IMPORTANT!** These patterns are not meant to predict price action, do not expect that they will 
always form perfect patterns. But keep it in mind when you notice them, that a reversal is likely coming.
