 Spot vs Perpetual Futures

**Spot:** Exchanging fiat current for crypto currency or another 
crypto currency for another at the current market price. You receive
and own the action coin.

**Perpetual Futures (Perps):** A derivative contract that allows you to
speculate on the future price of a coin without actually owning it. Offers
margin (leverage), which means you open a position with a fraction of the 
price (similar to options).

These function similarly to the way options v. equity works. Long term 
investments should be made in a spot market, while short term investments
should be made in a futures market.
