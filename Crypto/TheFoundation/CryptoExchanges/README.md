# Crypto Exchanges

## CEX vs DEX

**CEX (Centralized Exchange):** When you give your money to these exchanges,
it is no longer your money, until you withdrawal it. Examples include, 
Binance, Bybit, bitMEX, OKX and Kucoin.

**DEX (Decentralized Exchange):** You connect a wallet to this kind of exchange,
which allows you to store the coins you purchase. Examples include GMX. A 
safe option because your money is not at risk of being stolen by the exchange
or a malfunction.
