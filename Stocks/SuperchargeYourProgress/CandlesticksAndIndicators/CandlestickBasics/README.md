# Candlesticks

### Types of Candles
- **Momentum**: Candles with large bodies and small wicks. Buyers or sellers 
  are in control.
- **Indecision**: Candles with small bodies and large wicks. Buyer nor sellers 
  are in control.
- **Rejection**: Candles with small bodies at top or bottom and large wicks the 
  other way. Buyers/sellers were in control but lost control during the candle 
  and a reverse took place.

Bellow is the list of how to understand them:
- **Bullish Engulfing**: The sellers were in control but in the second candle 
  the buyers took control and negated the previous candles action. Usually takes
  place during a reversal.
- **Bearish Engulfing**: The buyers were in control but in the second candle the 
  sellers took control and negated the previous candles action. Usually takes 
  place during a reversal.

- **Morning Star**: The sellers were in control and then an indecision candle 
  took place. The buyers took control and negated the previous candles action. 
  Usually takes place during a reversal.
- **Evening Star**: The buyers were in control and then an indecision candle 
  took place. The sellers took control and negated the previous candles action. 
  Usually takes place during a reversal.

- **Bullish Pin Bar**: The sellers were in control but the buyers took control
  but then in the next candle the sellers took control again. By the end, the
  sellers were in control.
- **Bearish Pin Bar**: The buyers were in control but the sellers took control
  but then in the next candle the buyers took control again. By the end, the

##### Not always trusting this, AKA an inside candle
- **Bullish Harami**: The sellers were in control but the buyers took control 
  and created an inside candle. High chance of reversal.
- **Bearish Harami**: The buyers were in control but the sellers took control 
  and created an inside candle. High chance of reversal.


### General Notes
A momentum candle coming into a level/zone is not as important as a momentum 
candle coming out of a level/zone. 

E.g. A large green candle coming out of a zone is a strong sign of a bullish
trend. However, a large green candle coming into a zone is not as strong of a
sign of a trend or reversal.

The term **break and hold above** means a strong momentum candle that breaks
above a zone and then closes above the zone. This is a strong sign of a bullish
trend and an indication that the buyers are in control.
