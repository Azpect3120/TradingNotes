# Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is used to assess the strength/momentum of a movement. Goes from 
0 to 100. Most people define overbought as 70 and oversold as 30. However, this does not always rain 
true. Just because the RSI crosses 70 or 30, it does not indicate a reversal. At those points we should
look for divergence.

The other line (base MA) is the moving average of the RSI. When the RSI is above the base MA, it is
considered bullish momentum. When it is below, it is considered bearish momentum.

##### Size
- **14** is the most common size
- **5** could be used for scalping

##### Divergences
- **Bullish**: When the price is making lower lows but the RSI is not.
- **Bearish**: When the price is making higher highs but the RSI is not.

- **Hidden**: When the RSI is making higher highs but the price is not and vise versa.
  Much less common but they do occur, the market usually loses hope in the move and reverses.

Divergences are a good indicator of a slowing momentum and a possible reversal.
**Much stronger** sign compared to oversold or overbought signals.

##### The Momentum Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Works very similar to the RSI, the 0 line is the average and values above are bullish and below are 
bearish. They are used the same way even though their calculations are different. Using the MACD and
the RSI is a bit redundant.
