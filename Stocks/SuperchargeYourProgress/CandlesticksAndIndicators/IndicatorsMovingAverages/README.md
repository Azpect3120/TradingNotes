# Simple Moving Average (SMA)

It displays the average price of a stock over a period of time. The **length** of the
duration is determined by the length of the input and the tables current settings.
Eg. a length of 9 in a 1 hour chart will display the average price of the stock over
the last 9 hours. 

##### Some example usages:

- If the average of the stock over the last 50 days is raising, it is a medium term
bullish(up) signal.
