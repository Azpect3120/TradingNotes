# Market Zones

Market zones are areas or price points on a chart that define a point of interest, 
such as support, resistance, or a breakout level. These zones can be used in the 
monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday time frames. 


### Key Takeaways
- When trading daily zones, it is best to find entry and exit points on an hourly 
  chart.
- When trading hourly zones, it is best to find entry and exit points on a 
  15-minute chart.
- Looking for points of consolidation can determine your entry or exit points.
- A moving average (SMA) with a length of 50 can be used to help prevent over trading
- When the SMA is active on a 5min-15min chart, teacher recommends only entering long 
  positions when price is above the line and only entering short positions when the 
  price is below the line.
- When trading on the hourly, the prices are a lot more clean so the rule is less 
  important, but still a good filter.
- It is key to remember that a zone is not an EXACT price point, but a range where
  commonly reacts.


### When to Use Ranges/Boxes
- When the support/resistance lines are fairly wide, a range/box can be used to show 
  that the zone is large and not a specific price level.
- When the zone is very tight; a single line can be used to show that the zone is 
  small and specific.

### Terms
- **Consolidation**: A period of time when the price is moving "sideways"
