# Straddles and Strangles

#### Straddle
- Expectation of a large move but no dias on direction
- Buy a call and put with the same strike price and expiration date.
- Bottom straddle vs top straddle.

The only way to lose is if the price does not move at all. The more the price moves,
the more you win. As long as the move is significant enough to cover the premium of 
each option.


#### Strangle
- Expectation of a large move but no bias on direction.
- Buy a call and put with different strikes and same expiration date.
- Lower risk than straddle. Price has to move farther than straddle for profit.

Spending less on the premium, but the price has to move farther in order to make
a profit.

The zone between the two strikes is the zone where you lose the most money. If the 
call expires less and the put expires more, you lose the most money. That is the zone.

The move that happens needs to be bigger than what the market was expecting.
