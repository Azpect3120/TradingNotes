# Butterflies & Iron Condors

## Butterflies
- Expectation of price to be range bound.
- Buy a call with strike *A*, sell two calls with strike *B*, and buy a call with
strike *C* where *A* < *B* < *C*.

The calls that you buy, envelop the calls that you sell. As long as price stays within
the strike of the calls you buy, the calls you sell with expire worthless and the calls 
you buy will make a profit. If price leaves the range, you will end up with a loss.


## Iron Condors
- Expectation of price to be range bound.
- Combination of a bull put spread and bear call spread.
- Premium received.

You are expecting the price to stay within a certain range.

Capped losses and capped winnings. The winnings are based on the premium received 
from the bull put spread and bear call spread.

Typically a better option compared to butterflies.
