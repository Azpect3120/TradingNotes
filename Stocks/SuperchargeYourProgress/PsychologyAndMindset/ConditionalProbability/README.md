# Conditional Probability

`Probability`: The changes of something taking place with given odds

`Conditional Probability`: Probabilties change as new information narrows the universe of 
  possibilities
    - Russian roulette
    - Picking a specific card from a deck of card

### Market Examples

- Failed breakouts and breakdowns: The probability of the market direction changes when a 
  breakout fails
- Reversal candles at major levels: The probability of the market direction changes when a 
  candle rejects at a zone
- Stock selloff on good earnings: Sellers took control, even though market had good earnings 
  and the probability is that the market is in favor of the bears

### Mindset Adjustments

Probabilities in the market are **always** adjusting based on price info. Our job is to adjust
our trades with the new probabilities. **Strong opionions, loosely held.** Once the data moves
against you, you must chance your opinion.
