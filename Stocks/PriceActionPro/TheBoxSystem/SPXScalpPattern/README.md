# The SPX Scalp Pattern

A big problem scalpers have is overtrading. This is because they believe that scalping
is all about quantity and not quality. Scalping is better off making a big trade than
making a bunch of time profit. It is best to use a larger time frame (not the 1m or 5m)
and make a good chunk and call it quits. Shorter time frames like the 1 minute have a 
lot of fake out signals.

A lot of these scalping strategies will work on the NASDAQ as well as the S&P.
Possible tickers for S&P include: **SPY**, **SPX** and **SPLG** (**SPXU** shorts the S&P)
Possible tickers for NASDAQ include: **QQQ**, **NDX** and **ONEQ** (**SQQQ** shorts the NASDAQ)


## Scalping SPX
- Looking for 2-3 hours of sideways consolidation and then a breakout
- Trading when the market opens can be dangerous as there is high volatility
- Sideways ranges between 2-3 hours limit the volatility and allow for perfect Scalping


## Intraday Trading With SPY and QQQ
The price of QQQ and SPY relative to each other and to the market can give us a good bias
for the day.

#### There are four main scenarios:
- When QQQ is stronger than SPY and both are above the 9HMA, the market is usually bullish.
- When QQQ is weaker than SPY and both are below the 9HMA, the market is usually bearish.
- When QQQ is weaker than SPY and the market is choppy and green, the market will have a 
  choppy move higher.
- When QQQ is stronger than SPY and the market is choppy and red, the market will have a 
  choppy move lower.


## Relationship between VIX and SPX
CBOE VIX index is a mesaure of the potential volatility expected in the S&P500 over the next
30 days.

#### Volatility
What is volatility? An expectation of how fast prices change.

Calculated using the weighted prices of multiple SPX puts and calls over a wide range of strike
prices. Only options who expiry lies within the 23 and 37 days are used for the calculation.

#### VIX Trick
VIX division by 16% can give you an **estimated** intraday range for the markets.

Eg. If VIX is 16, then 2/3rd of the times markets will stay within 1% range for the day.

When VIX is bellow the 50MA, the market is usually bullish. If it is above the 50MA, the market
can be neutral OR bearish. Best conditions for trading are when VIX is making new lows and market
is making new highs. When VIX is making new highs and market is making new lows, it is a sign of
a bearish market. When both are making new highs, it is a sign of a choppy market and you should
reduce your risk.
