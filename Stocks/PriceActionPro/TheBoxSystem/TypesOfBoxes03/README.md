# Kinds of Boxes

Using moving averages (9MA and 50MA) to help validate moves using momentum. If the 9MA 
is rising and the price is above the line, it usually indicates a bullish trend. If the
9MA is flat and the price is consolidating, it usually indicates a loss of momentum.
They can be used as filters to help make decisions on trades in both long and short term.


##### Base Box
- Large box around a time period where the price is consolidating but also moving up and 
  down inside inside the box. 
- The moving averages are usually pretty flat inside these boxes.
- The price will usually have lots of momentum when it leaves the box.
- Both the 9MA and 50MA lines are flat.
- Upon breakout, a 9MA trend will begin and many 9MA boxes will form.
- Bigger boxes are more reliable and stronger than smaller boxes.


##### 50MA Box
- When the price is consolidating and the 9MA line is flat, but the 50MA line is rising.
- The price will usually break out of the box when the 50MA line reaches the box.
- The 50MA line is approaching the box and the 9MA line is flat.
- Usually takes place when the 9MA trend has slowed down or ended.


##### 9MA Box
- Very similar to the 50MA box, but happens much faster and is usually a smaller box.
- Functions very similar to the 50MA box, but the 9MA line is approaching the box and the 
  50MA line can usually be ignored. As this is a very short term box, and the 50MA line
  indicates a longer term trend.
- When the 9MA line is approaching the box, the price will usually break out of the box.
- When the 9MA trend has ended, the price will usually consolidate again longer term and 
  create a 50MA box until the 50MA catches up.
