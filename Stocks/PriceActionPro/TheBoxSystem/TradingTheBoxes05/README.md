# Trading Boxes

- When trading long term base boxes, when the price breaks out of the box, it is usually
  best to ride the trend until the price dips bellow the 50MA line.
- Base boxes are tough to track short term so they are best to trade with equity (not 
  options), waiting like mentioned above.
- The first 50MA box directly after a base box is the most reliable. You can size bigger.
- A 50MA box is typically made up of 3-4 weeks of price action which means they can break
  out for up to a week or more before the price will begin to consolidate again.
- When buying an option based on a 50MA box, you will want to buy the option with the 
  expiration date that is about the same time or more that the box was made up of.
- Not all 50MA boxes are the same, but the first one after a base box is the most 
  reliable.
- Movement in a 9MA box typically dies down within 2-3 days of consolidation.
