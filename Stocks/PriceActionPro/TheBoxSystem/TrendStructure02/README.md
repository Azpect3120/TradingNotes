# Trend Structure 

The box system is built off of the zone method which uses zones to location times in 
the market where a stock is consolidating. When the market leaves the box, a trend
will likely begin.

Boxes should be drawn on the chart where the stock is consolidating. The box can be 
used to mark the high and low of the consolidation. When the stock leaves the box,
a trend is likely to begin.


#### Trend
- A trend is a direction that the market is moving in.
- Higher highs and higher lows is an uptrend (bullish).
- Lower highs and lower lows is a downtrend (bearish).
- Trends that explode rapidly are called parabolic trends, and are often followed by a 
  sharp reversal (blowoff phase).


#### Highs and Lows
- Highs are the highest price that the stock has reached in a local area.
- Lows are the lowest price that the stock has reached in a local area.
- Higher highs/lows indicate a bullish trend.
- Lower highs/lows indicate a bearish trend.


### Zones inside the box

Price will commonly follow the zones (like we learned in the zone trading bit) while
inside the box. Price will commonly bounce off the zones and move back towards the
other zones in the box. Also, the price can exit the box and retest the box, even 
re-enter, but typically, it will not.

Stocks that have high growth potential will trend. Dividend stocks do not trend, forex 
does not trend. Those markets value stability and will not trend, they are providing 
dividend because they are not growing. Commodities do trend, and high growth stocks like
tech stocks will trend.

Zone-to-zone trading works best for forex and dividend stocks.
