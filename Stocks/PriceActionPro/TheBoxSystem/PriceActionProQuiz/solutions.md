## Solutions

#### 1: The price is dancing above a zone and hasn't broken bellow, what should you do?

*c) Do nothing*

**Explanation:** If the price is dancing above a zone and hasn't broken below it, it's 
best to wait and see what happens. There's no clear signal to go long or short, so it's 
better to stay on the sidelines until a clear direction is established.

#### 2: What's a trend?

*A trend is a period of momentum in the price (either up or down) which is commonly supported 
by a moving average, either the 50MA or the 21MA (and im some short term cases, the 9MA). An 
uptrend is characterized by higher highs and higher lows, while a downtrend is characterized
by lower highs and lower lows.*

#### 3: Which of these is a valid box?

*d) All of the above*

**Explanation:** All three types of boxes (Base Box, 50MA Box, 9MA Box) are valid and can be
used to identify potential trading opportunities. Each type of box has its own characteristics
and can be used in different market conditions.

#### 4: Which box breakout is the most reliable for a multi day swing?

*b) 50MA box breakout*

**Explanation:** A 50MA box breakout is more reliable for a multi-day swing as it indicates 
stronger momentum in the market. A 9MA box breakout is more suited for trend continuation,
while a base box breakout can be used for short and long term trades, however, the first 50MA
box following a base box is considered the most reliable for any trade.

#### 5: If you're looking for multi-day swings, what timeframe should you be using for searching setups?

*c) Daily*

**Explanation:** For multi-day swings, the daily timeframe is most commonly used to search for
setups. This allows traders to identify potential opportunities that may play out over several
days or weeks. Using the daily timeframe provides a good balance between capturing short-term
price movements and longer-term trends. An argument could be made that a 4 hour chart could also
be used, but the daily chart is the most common timeframe for multi-day swings. However, entries 
may take place on the 4 hour or even 1 hour chart.

#### 6: What tickers should you use to gauge the overall market environment?

*The tickers `$QQQ` and `$SPY` can be used to trade the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 respectively. 
They are a common indicator of the overall market environment, when they are trending up,
the market is usually in favor of an uptrend and vise versa. This is because the indices move 
with respect to the top players in the market.*

#### 7: How do you assess the strength of a specific sector in the overall market context?

*On weekends, while the market is closed, the weekly charts can be analyzed to locate sectors
which are estimated to be the most profitable in the upcoming week. This can be aided by looking
at a screener and looking for patterns in the results as well as comparing the relative strength
of the sector against the S&P 500 (SPY).*
