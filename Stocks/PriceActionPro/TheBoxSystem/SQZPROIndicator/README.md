# Squeeze Pro Indicator (sqzpro)

The dots in the center line of the indicator represent the tightness of the contraction
of the stock and therefore the how big the expansion will be.

Based on the Boligner Bands and Keltner Channels.
- The BB measures information based on daily closes
- The KC measures information based on daily highs and lows (defines volatility based on gap 
  between highs and lows)

If the bands are tight, it means the market did not move much. However, if the market moves high 
and then low but closes at the same(ish) price, the channels will notice this and show high 
volatility.

##### How to read the indicator:

**The dots:**
- Green dot: no consolidation
- Orange dot: mild consolidation
- Red dot: tight consolidation
- Yellow dot: no consolidation but some volatility

**Green dots** are a good indicator of **no contraction** and **no boxes**.
**Orange dots** can be a good indicator of a **contraction**.
**Red dots** will be stronger than orange dots and will create a **stronger box** you can trade from.
**Yellow dots** will create the **tightest box** you will see and a very **strong contraction**.

The **tighter** the box, the **stronger** the move will be.
This indicator should be used as a **screener** to find boxes or prove boxes.
