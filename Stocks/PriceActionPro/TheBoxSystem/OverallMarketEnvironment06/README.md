# Overall Market Environment

When the market is in a downtrend, it is very hard for single stocks to work against 
the market and produce and uptrend. The market is the tide that lifts all boats. 
When the market is in an uptrend, it is easier for stocks to move up.

### How to determine the market environment
- Commonly used indices are the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100. With a heavy focus on the
  S&P 500.
- If the market is above the latest DAILY ZONE, it can usually be considered in favor
  of an uptrend. When trading in larger time frames, such as weeks, the market should
  be in favor of an uptrend when price is above the latest WEEKLY ZONE.
- A simple rule can be made of the statement above, whatever time period you are trading,
  the market should be above the latest zone for that time period (assuming you are buying
  long).
- When the indices are in favor, there is a higher probability that a box breakout will
  succeed. When the indices are consolidating or choppy, the probability of a box breakout
  succeeding is lower.


### A "Hack"
- The 9MA can be used to estimate the recent zone. If the price is above the 9MA it can
  usually mean the market is in favor, and when the price is below the 9MA, the market
  is not typically in favor. This is a PRETTY GOOD (not perfect) approximation of the
  current market environment.
- Not perfect or "bullet proof" but can be a good proxy for the market environment.
- When price is bellow the 50MA but above the 9MA (between the two), the market is usually
  consolidating (choppy). This is a good time to be cautious and not take large positions.
- When the market is "choppy" on the weekly chart, it is best to avoid taking positions 
  on box breakouts as they are unreliable.

##### Basic Rule Table
- **Above** the 9MA and **above** the 50MA: Market is bullish.
- **Below** the 9MA and **above** the 50MA: Market is consolidating (choppy).
- **Below** the 9MA and **below** the 50MA: Market is bearish.
