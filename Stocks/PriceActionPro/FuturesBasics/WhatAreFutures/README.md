# The Basics of Futures

- Very lucrative because of the built-in leverage they provide.
- To view the specs of a future, simple google `cme 'future' specs`
  - cmegroup.com
- They can be traded the same way a stock is traded, but once you understand how
they function, you can make more money with them.
- The only thing that really matters are the margins of the future.
- A future marked with `1!` defines the front month future (next month) and with each 
number it increases.
