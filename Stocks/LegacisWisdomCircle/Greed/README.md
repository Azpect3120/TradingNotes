# Greed
Greed is **not** good, ever. 

### Negates your System
- Selling early and buying late
    - Following your system is the only way to make good trades.
    - Following your feelings is the easiest way to make poor trades.
- You're likely chasing
- Over sizing positions
    - When you see something good, ensure you do not over size. 
    - This will trigger an emotional response during the trade and 
      therefor you will not be able to follow your system clearly.

### Emotional Damage
- Trading is not an emotional game, it is a logical game.
- However, greed is an emotional that can easily take over and 
  ruin your trades.
- Once an emotional response is accepted, it commonly returns
  and can be difficult to ignore.
- Best to step away until you have a clear mind.

### Clearly Defined Logic
- Book recommendations
    - Nicolas Darwas: How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market
    - Tom Hougaard: Best Losers Wins
- Expectations should be clearly defined before entering a trade
  and should be followed through with.

### Mitigate Greed
- Journaling and backtesting
    - Builds a confidence in your system which allows you to 
      trust it and ignore greed.
- Clear goals and expectations
- Patience, automation and alerts
    - Use the tools we have in front of us to automate our trades
      which helps to remove the emotional aspect of trading.
