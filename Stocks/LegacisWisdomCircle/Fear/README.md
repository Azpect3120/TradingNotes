# Fear

### Emotional Trading
- Almost **always** fear based
    - Fear of missing out (FOMO)
    - Fear of pain
    - Fear of being wrong
    - Fear of limited opportunity
        - This is just bullshit, the market has endless 
          opportunities. The ONE you "missed" is not the 
          end of the world.
- Greed cycle
    - Greed and excitement -> BUY
    - Fear and anxiety -> SELL
    - Become impatient -> REPEAT

### Fear-Centric Market Events
- Dot-Com bubble (FOMO)
    - Everyone wanted to buy tech stocks because they were
      going up.
- 2008 Financial Crisis (fear of pain)
    - Everyone wanted to sell because they were scared of the 
      market crashing.
- GMA Surge (FOMO/Fear of limited opportunity)
    - Everyone wanted to buy because they were scared of 
      missing out on the next big thing.
    - We need to get in because everyone else is getting in.
- Every ALTCoin Season/Dino Coins (Fear of pain and limited opportunity)
    - Everyone wants to buy because they are scared of missing
      out on the next big thing.
    - Everyone wants to sell because they are scared of losing
      their profits.

### Specific Trader Examples
Buying over-extended stocks runs (hype stocks, meme coins, 2 higher highs/lows)
- When a stock reaches two higher highs or lows, it is likely
  over-extended and will likely cool down.
- When the stock makes lows after highs, many people will be scared
  and sell. When this is simply what happens!

Averaging into losing plays (with no setups); then selling when you break even.
- Fear in one realm often leads to fear in another realm.

Getting attached to a stock/asset
- Knowing much about a stock is fine and following it is fine, but there 
  must be no bias or attachment to the stock. DO NOT enter without a setup.

Buying into a stock "because it is down a lot"
- This has no bearing, to whom is the market down? It is all relative.
- Wait for setups.

Premature selling
- Greed and fear are the main culprits here.
- Fear of losing their gains is huge here.

Buying IPO launches
- No price history, no setups, no data. This is a gamble.
- Legaci tends to wait for 4-6 financial earnings before entering.
- "I want to get in the hype" is not a good reason (FOMO).

Shorting a stock after closing a long play for a loss
- Very similar to revenge trading.
- This is an emotional trade, not a logical one.
- Buying back the other way as soon as you lose shows a fear of being wrong.

Impatience
- A lot of action (uncommonly on Fridays) takes place in the first few hours.
- Impatience is fear in it of itself.
- Winning slightly less is better than losing a lot, take your time and wait for setups 
  and confirmations.

### Only One Way to Mitigate it...
Follow your system, always. That is the only way.
