### Why?
- Risk Management
- Comfort
    - Having a strong positive feeling is powerful but only
      in the beginning.
- Ensures Capital Return
- Instant Gratification

### But...
- Many of these are emotional/counter to systems
- "If the trade reverses..." not a good reason
- The long term effects with hinder your performance
    - You will begin to reinforce this idea of using emotions
      to make trades.
- Just because you see money in your account does not 
  mean you should take it out.
    - This will not teach you any lessons in the long term.
    - You cannot grow in comfort.

### Good Reasons to Take Early Profits
- Momentum changes or technical analysis
- News or events
- Personal reasons (e.g. can't monitor a trade)
- These reasons must true to your personality
- These reasons must also be reinforcing the right parts of
  your system.
    - Do not ever reinforce the emotional side of trading.
    - Chasing or revenge trading a perfect (awful) example
      of this.
