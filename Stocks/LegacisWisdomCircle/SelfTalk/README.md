# Self Talk
As a Man Thinketh - James Allen is a great book to read on this topic.

The way you talk to yourself matters, be honest with yourself and do 
not speak down to yourself. It will not help you.

### You vs Your Brain
- What is real vs what is not
    - Your brain does not know the difference between what is real
      and what is not.
    - "Oh I sold now, it should pump for you guys," this is telling your
      brain that you are not a good trader and your behavior will follow.
- No, its not just affirmations
- Control thoughts to control behavior


### Winners Do Not Self Loathe
- Winners do not self loathe, they learn from their mistakes and move on.
- The more you believe in yourself, the better you will perform long term.


### Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset
- The difference between abundance or scarcity
- Focus and clarity
- Reduce fear and emotions


### Building Neural Connections
- Every time you speak less of yourself, your brain create a new negative
  pathway. This is also true in the positive sense
- Behavior reinforcement
- Use questions to open up your brain

### Be Realistic
- Beware of the thin line between delusion and reality
- Do not just say, do
- Accountability and adaptability
- Maintain professionalism
    - When a problem arises, professionals do not blame others, they
      take responsibility, adapt and find a solution.
