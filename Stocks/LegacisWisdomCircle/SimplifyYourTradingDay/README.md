# Simplify Your Trading Day
**K.I.S.S -> KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID**

The ease of your actions can be directly correlated to your success.

### The Power Of Simplicity
- Trading isn't what you see on "IG/Tik Tok"
    - Trading is a job and should be treated as such.
- Direct correlation between simplicity and success - this is why business
  creates a system.
    - Become a robot, follow your system.
    - Become efficient and effective.
- Market is designed to confuse you
    - With so much information, it is easy to get lost.
    - Simplify your trading day to avoid this.

### It's a Work Day, Act Like It
- Distraction Free Environments.
    - Include cleanliness.
    - Less is more, try not to get lost in the clutter.
- Having a morning routine/afternoon routine.
    - Having a routine and sticking to it will help you to 
      become more efficient and negate distractions.
    - Having little bits of accomplishment throughout the day
      will help to keep you motivated.
- Prepare for your day like it's a work/school presentation.
    - Each day you need to be ready to take on all the 
      challenges that come your way.

### Pre-Market Simplification
- Identify 2-4 trades you like
    - About 1 hour of time, and I do this without opinions of others to 
      influence me.
- Set automations and alerts
    - Note down the alerts you want so when they go off you don't have to 
      think about it.
- Pre-Market Check
    - Indices, VIX, futures, ETF in sector of trade, news on stocks I might 
      trade, earnings,catalysts, red folder events, etc.
    - Check options on trades, and write down the play/expiry/price/etc
- Check into *The Real World*
    - Daily analysis, AMA, etc.

### During The Day
- Check hourly closes
    - Use your watchlist
- Always scroll out
- Follow THE plan, not someone else
    - Focus on yourself and your trades, not others.
- Avoid news/media
    - This is a distraction and can lead to emotional trading.
    - Don't get caught up in the noise.
- Take MAX 3 trades

AND...
"BE willing to watch your plays, not waste your days"

You do not need to watch the market all day, you need to watch your plays.
Give yourself some time to step away. You do not need to be in the market 
all day. Knowing when to step away is very important.
