# The Box System

Stock markets are fractals, which means the time frame you are looking at is irrelevant, if
a system works in a liquid market, it will work in any time frame. This rule applies for the 
box system as well!

When a base box breakout occurs to the downside, a downtrend typically begins. A downtrend is 
defined as a series of lower highs and lower lows. When a downtrend is confirmed, the price 
should never reach higher than the previous swing high. A moving stop should be placed just 
above the most recent swing high. Each time a new high is confirmed, the stop should be moved
down to the newly made swing high. If the downtrend is confirmed, the price should never reach
higher than the previous swing high.

Long term investors should ride **trends**. The box system is a great way to identify trends
and ride them.

The same rule applies for up trends. The price should never reach the swing low, and a moving
stop should be placed just bellow the most recent swing low. Each time a new low is confirmed,
the stop should be moved up to the newly made swing low. If the uptrend is confirmed, the price
should never reach lower than the previous swing low.

It is recommended to take partials at each higher zone or lower zone (in shorts) to lock in 
profits during the trend.

When long term trading, the basics do not matter, all you need to do is hard the trend as long 
as possible. Patience is key. We are not looking for HUGE fast gains, but long term consistent
profits.

Your stops need to be tight, to prevent large losses if a trend is not confirmed or reverses.

For the most part, strong trends will ride the 9MA line, when you see price crossing the 9MA 
or consolidating bellow or on the 9MA line, it could be time to exit prematurely. This applies 
for the weekly or monthly charts. However, the 9MA is simply a guide, the trend structure is 
based on the higher highs and lows.

Dividend stocks **DO NOT TREND!!** They are not growing, they are stable and are not meant to be 
traded.

Large cap tech stocks are not known for having large down trends. Large cap growth stocks are 
depended on for growth by investors and indexes, they are likely to have strong uptrends and less 
likely to have strong downtrends.
