## Box System for LTIs

The only difference between a long term investor and a short term investor is 
the time frame in which they are looking at the market. Long term investments
are in the range of 6 months to 2 years. Anything past 2 years its hard to 
predict what will happen.

The duration of the position is based on the same factors as a short term 
investment, the number of candles in the box/consolidation.

A strong daily box at the top right corner of a weekly box is a good confluence.
Also known as the BnB (Bread and Butter) pattern.

Option expiration should be 1.5 to 2 months out MINIMUM. If a weekly play is 
going to run its course, the options need time.

Swing trades take place on the daily chart, options can be 2 to 4 weeks out.

Monthly plays could take 6 months to a year to run their course, best to play 
with equity since options can be touchy that far out.

Long story short, the system functions the same way as a short term system, due
to the fact that the market is a fractal. The only difference is the time frame.
