# Historical Presidential Cycle

Year 1 & 2 are usually the most mediocre years and years 3 & 4
are usually the stronger years. This is because a new President 
tries to enact new policies in the first two years and the market
reacts to those policies. In the midterms, the power in the party 
reduces and the President has less luck with enacting policies. 
Furthermore, in the final years, the people in power are scared
to lose their job and do not pass new policies that might scare the
market.

#### Data points (1928-2012)

- Year 1: 03.96%
- Year 2: 04.49%
- Year 3: 13.46% (historically, never negative)
- Year 4: 07.00%

#### Reelect or not?

When a President is new, that is when we see weakness in Y1 & Y2.
When the president is reelected, the market is stronger in Y1 & Y2, 
and begins to weaken in Y4. This is because the market is not scared 
of the new President and the President has no need to enact new policies
right away.
