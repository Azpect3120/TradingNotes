#### Demand Shifts

Based on the market sentiment, fear v. greed.
Demand can shift very quickly due to the rapid speed at which sentiment
shifts.

#### Supply Shifts

Supply is pretty consistent 12-18 months down the line. Major shifts take
palce at the sector economic extremes. Long term supply (5, 10, 20) years 
down the line cannot be determined. 

When a sector becomes too hot, the supply increases and the demand increases,
which leads to a bubble. When it pops, the sector will sell off and demand will
drop bringing supply with it. When supply booms like this with lots of IPOS, 
it is a strong sign that the sector will do poorly long term. Do not get over
excited and make bad decisions.

A single sector cannot be hot forever, the bankers will eventually drown the 
market and the sector will sell off. It's very hard to determine what factors
will impact the supply 5, 10, or 20 years down the line.

Do not get blown away by buying a holding sectors for the long run, it will take
decades to recover from a bubble. The guys who make long term estimates are 
almost always wrong, do not trust their predictions.

**The market is NOT rational because it is driven by the demand side, fueled by 
irrational people who are driven by sentiment.**
