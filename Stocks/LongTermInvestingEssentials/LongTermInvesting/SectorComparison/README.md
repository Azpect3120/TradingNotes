![Stock Market Sector Returns](https://github.com/Azpect3120/TradingNotes/blob/master/Stocks/LongTermInvesting/SectorComparison/sectorReturns.png)

Consumer Staples: Highest return with lowest std. dev.
- Always does well regardless of the market conditions.

Information Technology: Highest return with highest std. dev.
- Big moves upward, but also big moves downward.

**The key:** A bias on which sector is the *best* needs to be 
be tossed out. Do not chase a sector and make sure to diversify.
