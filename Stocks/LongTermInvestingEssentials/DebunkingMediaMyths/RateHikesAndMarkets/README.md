# Rate Hikes and the Markets

The FED dropping rates is a better sign of a recession rather than the FED 
raising rates. When the FED raises rates, it is a sign that the economy is
doing well and the FED is trying to slow it down. When the FED drops rates,
it is a sign that the economy is doing poorly and the FED is trying to liven
it up. Using the chart of the FED funds rate, you can see that the FED drops
rates when a recession is coming, not when the economy is doing well.
