## Questions

#### 1: What's the option available to the buyer of a put on expiration?

*b) Sell the underlying from the seller at strike price*

**Explanation:** When buying a put option, the buyer has the right to sell the underlying asset
to the seller at the strike price when the expiration date arrives. This allows the buyer to
profit from a decrease in the price of the underlying asset.

#### 2: What factors affect the price of an option?

*Intrinsic value which is the value of the option if it were to expire today, and extrinsic value
which is the time value of the option both affect the price. The price of an option is also affected
by the price of the underlying asset, the time until expiration, and the implied volatility (IV) of 
the option. A stock with higher IV will have higher premiums. Finally, the options strike price also
affects the price of the option. The closer the strike price is to the current price of the underlying
the more expensive the option will be.*

#### 3: If you would like to have your trade executed immediately, what order type will you choose 

*a) Market*

**Explanation:** A market order is used when you want your trade to be executed immediately at the
current market price. This type of order guarantees that your trade will be executed, but it may
not be filled at the exact price you expect. This is generally bad practice when trading options
because of the bid-ask spread. It may also result in a crazy (high or low) order being filled on 
accident and you losing money.

#### 4: When buying a call or a put, what option should you choose? 

*c) Buy to Open*

**Explanation:** When buying a call or a put, you should choose the "Buy to Open" option. This
indicates that you are opening a new position by buying the option contract. This is the most
common type of order when you want to enter a trade by purchasing an option. Many brokers will 
automatically select this option when you choose to buy an option, or not even show you that 
there is an option.

#### 5: What is the etf ticker that allows you to trade Nasdaq-100? 

*d) QQQ*

**Explanation:** The ETF ticker that allows you to trade the Nasdaq-100 is QQQ. This ETF tracks the
performance of the Nasdaq-100 index and provides traders with exposure to the largest non-financial
companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. QQQ is also traded at a fraction of the total cost of 
the Nasdaq-100. This is a great way to get exposure to the tech sector without having to buy individual
stocks.
