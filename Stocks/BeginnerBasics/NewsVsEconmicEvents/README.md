# Events that effect the market

## General Notes

- Effects of these events on the market usually happen a few days later but in the 
instant they are released, the market will become more volatile. Therefore, it is 
best for beginners to stay out of the market when these events are released.
- News is usually **bullshit** that try's to explain why the market moved the way it did.
- Economic events are the only things that can move the market.
- During events, many big funds will inject liquidity into the market to make it move, 
which defines another reason to sit out during these events.

## FOMC

- Does not happen every month.
- When markets are calm, FOMC will take place quatrerly (Mar., Jun., Sep., Dec.)
- Where the FED decides the interest rates.
- When the economy is overheated, the FED will raise the interest rates to cool 
  it down. (but I knew this from my Econ class)
- Decision comes out at 2PM and the Fed Chairmen will take place as 2:30PM.
- Initial move (2PM) is usually a fake move, and the real move is at 2:30PM.

## CPI

- Inflation report.
- If inflation is high, the value of your money goes down. If inflation is low,
the economy is stale and not doing well.
- CPI is released every month.

## NFP (Non Farms Payroll)

- Released on the first Friday of every month.
- Tells you how many non-farm jobs were created in the US.
- Tells you how many people are employed in the US.
- It is best to sit out when events like this take place and allow the market
to settle down before trading.
