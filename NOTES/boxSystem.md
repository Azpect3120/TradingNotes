# The Box System

The box system is built off of the zone method which uses zones to location times in 
the market where a stock is consolidating. When the market leaves the box, a trend
will likely begin.

Boxes should be drawn on the chart where the stock is consolidating. The box can be 
used to mark the high and low of the consolidation. When the stock leaves the box,
a trend is likely to begin.


#### Trend
- A trend is a direction that the market is moving in.
- Higher highs and higher lows is an uptrend (bullish).
- Lower highs and lower lows is a downtrend (bearish).
- Trends that explode rapidly are called parabolic trends, and are often followed by a 
  sharp reversal (blowoff phase).


#### Highs and Lows
- Highs are the highest price that the stock has reached in a local area.
- Lows are the lowest price that the stock has reached in a local area.
- Higher highs/lows indicate a bullish trend.
- Lower highs/lows indicate a bearish trend.


### Zones inside the box

Price will commonly follow the zones (like we learned in the zone trading bit) while
inside the box. Price will commonly bounce off the zones and move back towards the
other zones in the box. Also, the price can exit the box and retest the box, even 
re-enter, but typically, it will not.

Stocks that have high growth potential will trend. Dividend stocks do not trend, forex 
does not trend. Those markets value stability and will not trend, they are providing 
dividend because they are not growing. Commodities do trend, and high growth stocks like
tech stocks will trend.

Zone-to-zone trading works best for forex and dividend stocks.


### Kinds of Boxes
Using moving averages (9MA and 50MA) to help validate moves using momentum. If the 9MA 
is rising and the price is above the line, it usually indicates a bullish trend. If the
9MA is flat and the price is consolidating, it usually indicates a loss of momentum.
They can be used as filters to help make decisions on trades in both long and short term.


##### Base Box
- Large box around a time period where the price is consolidating but also moving up and 
  down inside inside the box. 
- The moving averages are usually pretty flat inside these boxes.
- The price will usually have lots of momentum when it leaves the box.
- Both the 9MA and 50MA lines are flat.
- Upon breakout, a 9MA trend will begin and many 9MA boxes will form.
- Bigger boxes are more reliable and stronger than smaller boxes.


##### 50MA Box
- When the price is consolidating and the 9MA line is flat, but the 50MA line is rising.
- The price will usually break out of the box when the 50MA line reaches the box.
- The 50MA line is approaching the box and the 9MA line is flat.
- Usually takes place when the 9MA trend has slowed down or ended.


##### 9MA Box
- Very similar to the 50MA box, but happens much faster and is usually a smaller box.
- Functions very similar to the 50MA box, but the 9MA line is approaching the box and the 
  50MA line can usually be ignored. As this is a very short term box, and the 50MA line
  indicates a longer term trend.
- When the 9MA line is approaching the box, the price will usually break out of the box.
- When the 9MA trend has ended, the price will usually consolidate again longer term and 
  create a 50MA box until the 50MA catches up.

### Trading Boxes
- When trading long term base boxes, when the price breaks out of the box, it is usually
  best to ride the trend until the price dips bellow the 50MA line.
- Base boxes are tough to track short term so they are best to trade with equity (not 
  options), waiting like mentioned above.
- The first 50MA box directly after a base box is the most reliable. You can size bigger.
- A 50MA box is typically made up of 3-4 weeks of price action which means they can break
  out for up to a week or more before the price will begin to consolidate again.
- When buying an option based on a 50MA box, you will want to buy the option with the 
  expiration date that is about the same time or more that the box was made up of.
- Not all 50MA boxes are the same, but the first one after a base box is the most 
  reliable.
- Movement in a 9MA box typically dies down within 2-3 days of consolidation.


### For Long Term Investors
Stock markets are fractals, which means the time frame you are looking at is irrelevant, if
a system works in a liquid market, it will work in any time frame. This rule applies for the 
box system as well!

When a base box breakout occurs to the downside, a downtrend typically begins. A downtrend is 
defined as a series of lower highs and lower lows. When a downtrend is confirmed, the price 
should never reach higher than the previous swing high. A moving stop should be placed just 
above the most recent swing high. Each time a new high is confirmed, the stop should be moved
down to the newly made swing high. If the downtrend is confirmed, the price should never reach
higher than the previous swing high.

Long term investors should ride **trends**. The box system is a great way to identify trends
and ride them.

The same rule applies for up trends. The price should never reach the swing low, and a moving
stop should be placed just bellow the most recent swing low. Each time a new low is confirmed,
the stop should be moved up to the newly made swing low. If the uptrend is confirmed, the price
should never reach lower than the previous swing low.

It is recommended to take partials at each higher zone or lower zone (in shorts) to lock in 
profits during the trend.

When long term trading, the basics do not matter, all you need to do is hard the trend as long 
as possible. Patience is key. We are not looking for HUGE fast gains, but long term consistent
profits.

Your stops need to be tight, to prevent large losses if a trend is not confirmed or reverses.

For the most part, strong trends will ride the 9MA line, when you see price crossing the 9MA 
or consolidating bellow or on the 9MA line, it could be time to exit prematurely. This applies 
for the weekly or monthly charts. However, the 9MA is simply a guide, the trend structure is 
based on the higher highs and lows.

Dividend stocks **DO NOT TREND!!** They are not growing, they are stable and are not meant to be 
traded.

Large cap tech stocks are not known for having large down trends. Large cap growth stocks are 
depended on for growth by investors and indexes, they are likely to have strong uptrends and less 
likely to have strong downtrends.
