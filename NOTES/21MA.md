# The Role of 21MA

The 21MA is a "balance" point between the time when the price reaches the 9MA
and when it drops bellow the 9MA. It is commonly used as a point of reference
for the price to bounce off of.

When a 9MA downtrend is over, price will typically push to the 21MA and then 
react at that point. It can either rise up to the 9MA recent high or drop back 
down to the 50MA.

When a 21MA rejection takes place, it will follow back to the top/bottom of the
previous trend.

When the price crosses the 21MA, it is a good indicator that the price will
jump to the other 9/50MA line, whichever is it crossing above/bellow.

When momentum is strong, sometimes the 21MA and 21MA boxes will be used to 
support the price, not the 50MA like it usually is.


## 21MA Box
- Similar to the 50MA box but based on the 21M line.
- The price will typically have a lot of momentum when it breaks out of a 
  21MA box.
- 21MA boxes have the **highest** chance of **failed** breakouts.

## Aayush's Reponse
There were times when price had strong momentum and would not wait for 50ma to catch up.
I looked into it and found that price found support around 21ma

## Summary
The 21MA line is a key indicator in the market. It is used as a balance point
between the 9MA and the 50MA which is commonly used to support the price and/or
reject price action.
