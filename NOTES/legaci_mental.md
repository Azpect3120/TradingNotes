# Legaci's Mental Game Notes
These are amazing...


## Greed
Greed is **not** good, ever. 

### Negates your System
- Selling early and buying late
    - Following your system is the only way to make good trades.
    - Following your feelings is the easiest way to make poor trades.
- You're likely chasing
- Over sizing positions
    - When you see something good, ensure you do not over size. 
    - This will trigger an emotional response during the trade and 
      therefor you will not be able to follow your system clearly.

### Emotional Damage
- Trading is not an emotional game, it is a logical game.
- However, greed is an emotional that can easily take over and 
  ruin your trades.
- Once an emotional response is accepted, it commonly returns
  and can be difficult to ignore.
- Best to step away until you have a clear mind.

### Clearly Defined Logic
- Book recommendations
    - Nicolas Darwas: How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market
    - Tom Hougaard: Best Losers Wins
- Expectations should be clearly defined before entering a trade
  and should be followed through with.

### Mitigate Greed
- Journaling and backtesting
    - Builds a confidence in your system which allows you to 
      trust it and ignore greed.
- Clear goals and expectations
- Patience, automation and alerts
    - Use the tools we have in front of us to automate our trades
      which helps to remove the emotional aspect of trading.


## Self Talk
As a Man Thinketh - James Allen is a great book to read on this topic.

The way you talk to yourself matters, be honest with yourself and do 
not speak down to yourself. It will not help you.

### You vs Your Brain
- What is real vs what is not
    - Your brain does not know the difference between what is real
      and what is not.
    - "Oh I sold now, it should pump for you guys," this is telling your
      brain that you are not a good trader and your behavior will follow.
- No, its not just affirmations
- Control thoughts to control behavior


### Winners Do Not Self Loathe
- Winners do not self loathe, they learn from their mistakes and move on.
- The more you believe in yourself, the better you will perform long term.


### Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset
- The difference between abundance or scarcity
- Focus and clarity
- Reduce fear and emotions


### Building Neural Connections
- Every time you speak less of yourself, your brain create a new negative
  pathway. This is also true in the positive sense
- Behavior reinforcement
- Use questions to open up your brain

### Be Realistic
- Beware of the thin line between delusion and reality
- Do not just say, do
- Accountability and adaptability
- Maintain professionalism
    - When a problem arises, professionals do not blame others, they
      take responsibility, adapt and find a solution.


## Taking Early Profits
Reminicences of a Stock Operator - Edwin Lefevre
The Disciplined Trader - Mark Douglas
Best Losers Wins - Tom Hougaard
Pyscho-Cybernetics - Maxwell Maltz (less vested in trading)

### Why?
- Risk Management
- Comfort
    - Having a strong positive feeling is powerful but only
      in the beginning.
- Ensures Capital Return
- Instant Gratification

### But...
- Many of these are emotional/counter to systems
- "If the trade reverses..." not a good reason
- The long term effects with hinder your performance
    - You will begin to reinforce this idea of using emotions
      to make trades.
- Just because you see money in your account does not 
  mean you should take it out.
    - This will not teach you any lessons in the long term.
    - You cannot grow in comfort.

### Good Reasons to Take Early Profits
- Momentum changes or technical analysis
- News or events
- Personal reasons (e.g. can't monitor a trade)
- These reasons must true to your personality
- These reasons must also be reinforcing the right parts of
  your system.
    - Do not ever reinforce the emotional side of trading.
    - Chasing or revenge trading a perfect (awful) example
      of this.


## Fear

### Emotional Trading
- Almost **always** fear based
    - Fear of missing out (FOMO)
    - Fear of pain
    - Fear of being wrong
    - Fear of limited opportunity
        - This is just bullshit, the market has endless 
          opportunities. The ONE you "missed" is not the 
          end of the world.
- Greed cycle
    - Greed and excitement -> BUY
    - Fear and anxiety -> SELL
    - Become impatient -> REPEAT

### Fear-Centric Market Events
- Dot-Com bubble (FOMO)
    - Everyone wanted to buy tech stocks because they were
      going up.
- 2008 Financial Crisis (fear of pain)
    - Everyone wanted to sell because they were scared of the 
      market crashing.
- GMA Surge (FOMO/Fear of limited opportunity)
    - Everyone wanted to buy because they were scared of 
      missing out on the next big thing.
    - We need to get in because everyone else is getting in.
- Every ALTCoin Season/Dino Coins (Fear of pain and limited opportunity)
    - Everyone wants to buy because they are scared of missing
      out on the next big thing.
    - Everyone wants to sell because they are scared of losing
      their profits.

### Specific Trader Examples
Buying over-extended stocks runs (hype stocks, meme coins, 2 higher highs/lows)
- When a stock reaches two higher highs or lows, it is likely
  over-extended and will likely cool down.
- When the stock makes lows after highs, many people will be scared
  and sell. When this is simply what happens!

Averaging into losing plays (with no setups); then selling when you break even.
- Fear in one realm often leads to fear in another realm.

Getting attached to a stock/asset
- Knowing much about a stock is fine and following it is fine, but there 
  must be no bias or attachment to the stock. DO NOT enter without a setup.

Buying into a stock "because it is down a lot"
- This has no bearing, to whom is the market down? It is all relative.
- Wait for setups.

Premature selling
- Greed and fear are the main culprits here.
- Fear of losing their gains is huge here.

Buying IPO launches
- No price history, no setups, no data. This is a gamble.
- Legaci tends to wait for 4-6 financial earnings before entering.
- "I want to get in the hype" is not a good reason (FOMO).

Shorting a stock after closing a long play for a loss
- Very similar to revenge trading.
- This is an emotional trade, not a logical one.
- Buying back the other way as soon as you lose shows a fear of being wrong.

Impatience
- A lot of action (uncommonly on Fridays) takes place in the first few hours.
- Impatience is fear in it of itself.
- Winning slightly less is better than losing a lot, take your time and wait for setups 
  and confirmations.

### Only One Way to Mitigate it...
Follow your system, always. That is the only way.


## Simplify Your Trading Day
**K.I.S.S -> KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID**

The ease of your actions can be directly correlated to your success.

### The Power Of Simplicity
- Trading isn't what you see on "IG/Tik Tok"
    - Trading is a job and should be treated as such.
- Direct correlation between simplicity and success - this is why business
  creates a system.
    - Become a robot, follow your system.
    - Become efficient and effective.
- Market is designed to confuse you
    - With so much information, it is easy to get lost.
    - Simplify your trading day to avoid this.

### It's a Work Day, Act Like It
- Distraction Free Environments.
    - Include cleanliness.
    - Less is more, try not to get lost in the clutter.
- Having a morning routine/afternoon routine.
    - Having a routine and sticking to it will help you to 
      become more efficient and negate distractions.
    - Having little bits of accomplishment throughout the day
      will help to keep you motivated.
- Prepare for your day like it's a work/school presentation.
    - Each day you need to be ready to take on all the 
      challenges that come your way.

### Pre-Market Simplification
- Identify 2-4 trades you like
    - About 1 hour of time, and I do this without opinions of others to 
      influence me.
- Set automations and alerts
    - Note down the alerts you want so when they go off you don't have to 
      think about it.
- Pre-Market Check
    - Indices, VIX, futures, ETF in sector of trade, news on stocks I might 
      trade, earnings,catalysts, red folder events, etc.
    - Check options on trades, and write down the play/expiry/price/etc
- Check into *The Real World*
    - Daily analysis, AMA, etc.

### During The Day
- Check hourly closes
    - Use your watchlist
- Always scroll out
- Follow THE plan, not someone else
    - Focus on yourself and your trades, not others.
- Avoid news/media
    - This is a distraction and can lead to emotional trading.
    - Don't get caught up in the noise.
- Take MAX 3 trades

AND...
"BE willing to watch your plays, not waste your days"

You do not need to watch the market all day, you need to watch your plays.
Give yourself some time to step away. You do not need to be in the market 
all day. Knowing when to step away is very important.
