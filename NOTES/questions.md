#### Solution from ChatGPT
When buying a call or a put option, the correct choice is **"Buy to Open"**. Here's a breakdown of what each term means and why "Buy to Open" is the right choice for purchasing options:

### Key Terms Explained

1. **Buy to Open**:
   - **Definition**: Initiating a new position by purchasing a call or put option.
   - **Use Case**: You use this when you want to buy an option contract, either a call (if you believe the underlying asset will increase in price) or a put (if you believe the underlying asset will decrease in price).
   - **Example**: Buying a call option on a stock because you expect its price to go up.

2. **Sell to Open**:
   - **Definition**: Opening a new position by selling an option contract that you do not currently own. This is typically done to write (sell) options.
   - **Use Case**: Used when you want to sell a call or put option to create a new position, usually with the expectation that the option will expire worthless or that the underlying asset will not move in a way that would make the option profitable for the buyer.
   - **Example**: Writing a call option if you think the stock will not rise above a certain price by the expiration date.

3. **Sell to Close**:
   - **Definition**: Closing an existing position by selling an option that you already own.
   - **Use Case**: Used when you want to exit an existing long position in an option. This means you previously bought an option and now want to sell it to realize gains or limit losses.
   - **Example**: Selling a call option that you previously bought to take profit if the stock price has risen as expected.

4. **Buy to Close**:
   - **Definition**: Closing an existing short position by purchasing an option you previously sold.
   - **Use Case**: Used when you have sold an option (opened a short position) and now want to buy it back to close the position, potentially to mitigate losses or realize profits.
   - **Example**: Buying back a put option you sold if the stock price has fallen, and you want to close the position before it falls further.

### Summary

- **"Buy to Open"**: Used to initiate a new position by buying call or put options.
- **"Sell to Open"**: Used to open a new position by selling (writing) call or put options.
- **"Sell to Close"**: Used to close a position where you own an option, selling it back to the market.
- **"Buy to Close"**: Used to close a position where you have sold an option, buying it back from the market.

If you are looking to **purchase** an option, you should choose **"Buy to Open"**. This action establishes your new position as the owner of the option, giving you the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset at the strike price before the option expires.

### What defines a 21MA box?
- Looks like a box that works exactly like the 50MA box but is based on the 21MA line.
- There were times when price had strong momentum and would not wait for 50ma to catch up. 
  I looked into it and found that price found support around 21ma

### What does parabolic phase mean?

The parabolic phase the phase when the price booms upward very quickly. It is usually followed 
by a sharp decline in price.
The low of the previous candle SHOULD NOT be lower than the of the candle before that. Another
way to prove a parabolic phase. Once this rule has been broken, the parabolic phase has ended.

### What does the TS box mean from the back testing video?

### What does "puts" vs "calls" mean?

A short option is a put, a long option is a call at the surface level. There are more complex terms you should learn later on.
If you think the price will go down, buy a put. If you think the price will go up, buy a call.
Puts Can also be seen as a short (sell) and Calls can also be seen as a long (buy).
