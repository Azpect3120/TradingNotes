# Watch List Creation


## Using A Screener
- Trading view has a built in screener that works pretty well.
- E.g. using the price -> crossing up -> SMA -> 9MA/50MA to see stocks that are crossing
  above the 9MA and 50MA line.


## What "He" Uses to Find Daily Swings
- Market: US
- Price: Crosses up -> SMA -> 9MA -> 1 Day
- Market Cap : Above 2B USD
- Price: Above -> SMA -> 50MA -> 1 Day
- Price: Above or Equal -> SMA -> 200MA -> 1 Day *This will amount to the 50MA on the 
  weekly chart, just an extra precaution*
- Bolinger Bands (Keltner Channels): Bolinger Bands 20 -> Upper < KC (20), Upper
- Bolinger Bands (Keltner Channels): Bolinger Bands 20 -> Lower > KC (20), Lower
- Volume: Above 500K


## Finding Market Sectors
On weekends, while market is closed, using the charts to locate the sectors that are
estimated to be the most profitable in the upcoming week. This is done by looking at 
the weekly chart and using our technical analysis to determine the sectors that are
most likely to be profitable.

Hoping to find a sector or stock that is going to be profitable in the upcoming week.

**Always** check the relative strength against the S&P 500 (SPY).
- e.g. AAPL vs SPY is AAPL/SPY
- *It may not always pop up on the list, just type it and hit enter*

If the stock is doing well against the SPY (in the chart provided above), they it can 
be a good indicator. However, a stock that is bearish against the SPY is not a good
indicator. Even if the stock is making a box or consolidating, it is still a good sign.


## Summary
Each day, the screener should be used to find potential stocks on the daily chart that
may be swingers. When many names from the same sector are found, it is a good indicator
that the sector is going to be profitable in the upcoming week. This can be confirmed by 
looking at the weekly chart and using technical analysis to determine the sectors that 
are most likely to be profitable. Then searching for the stocks in that sector that are
going to be profitable in the upcoming week. This can be done by checking the EFT holdings.
Don't start with stock that are low holdings in the EFT, start with high holdings. When a 
lot of the high holdings are doing well, it is a good indicator that the sector is going to
be profitable. The sector strength should **always** be compared to the S&P 500 (SPY). If 
the sector is doing well against the SPY, it is a good indicator. If the sector is bearish
against the SPY, it is not a good indicator. Even if the sector is making a box or 
consolidating.
