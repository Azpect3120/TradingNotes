## Sector Comparison 

Consumer Staples: Highest return with lowest std. dev.
- Always does well regardless of the market conditions.

Information Technology: Highest return with highest std. dev.
- Big moves upward, but also big moves downward.

**The key:** A bias on which sector is the *best* needs to be 
be tossed out. Do not chase a sector and make sure to diversify.


## Historical Presidential Cycle

Year 1 & 2 are usually the most mediocre years and years 3 & 4
are usually the stronger years. This is because a new President 
tries to enact new policies in the first two years and the market
reacts to those policies. In the midterms, the power in the party 
reduces and the President has less luck with enacting policies. 
Furthermore, in the final years, the people in power are scared
to lose their job and do not pass new policies that might scare the
market.

#### Data points (1928-2012)

- Year 1: 03.96%
- Year 2: 04.49%
- Year 3: 13.46% (historically, never negative)
- Year 4: 07.00%

#### Reelect or not?

When a President is new, that is when we see weakness in Y1 & Y2.
When the president is reelected, the market is stronger in Y1 & Y2, 
and begins to weaken in Y4. This is because the market is not scared 
of the new President and the President has no need to enact new policies
right away.


#### Data Points

    - New President: 6.8%
    - **Reelected President: 9.6**%

## Crystal Ball Range

#### Stocks Supply

- New stock issuances
- IPOs

- Bankruptcies
- Stock buybacks
- Cash-based M&A (Merger & Acquisition)

#### Demand Shifts

Based on the market sentiment, fear v. greed.
Demand can shift very quickly due to the rapid speed at which sentiment
shifts.

#### Supply Shifts

Supply is pretty consistent 12-18 months down the line. Major shifts take
palce at the sector economic extremes. Long term supply (5, 10, 20) years 
down the line cannot be determined. 

When a sector becomes too hot, the supply increases and the demand increases,
which leads to a bubble. When it pops, the sector will sell off and demand will
drop bringing supply with it. When supply booms like this with lots of IPOS, 
it is a strong sign that the sector will do poorly long term. Do not get over
excited and make bad decisions.

A single sector cannot be hot forever, the bankers will eventually drown the 
market and the sector will sell off. It's very hard to determine what factors
will impact the supply 5, 10, or 20 years down the line.

Do not get blown away by buying a holding sectors for the long run, it will take
decades to recover from a bubble. The guys who make long term estimates are 
almost always wrong, do not trust their predictions.

**The market is NOT rational because it is driven by the demand side, fueled by 
irrational people who are driven by sentiment.**

## Box System for LTIs

The only difference between a long term investor and a short term investor is 
the time frame in which they are looking at the market. Long term investments
are in the range of 6 months to 2 years. Anything past 2 years its hard to 
predict what will happen.

The duration of the position is based on the same factors as a short term 
investment, the number of candles in the box/consolidation.

### Entries

A strong daily box at the top right corner of a weekly box is a good confluence.
Also known as the BnB (Bread and Butter) pattern.

Option expiration should be 1.5 to 2 months out MINIMUM. If a weekly play is 
going to run its course, the options need time.

Swing trades take place on the daily chart, options can be 2 to 4 weeks out.

Monthly plays could take 6 months to a year to run their course, best to play 
with equity since options can be touchy that far out.

Long story short, the system functions the same way as a short term system, due
to the fact that the market is a fractal. The only difference is the time frame.


## Myths Debunked

The FED dropping rates is a better sign of a recession rather than the FED 
raising rates. When the FED raises rates, it is a sign that the economy is
doing well and the FED is trying to slow it down. When the FED drops rates,
it is a sign that the economy is doing poorly and the FED is trying to liven
it up. Using the chart of the FED funds rate, you can see that the FED drops
rates when a recession is coming, not when the economy is doing well.
