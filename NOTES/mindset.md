### Conditional Probability

`Probability`: The changes of something taking place with given odds

`Conditional Probability`: Probabilties change as new information narrows the universe of 
  possibilities
    - Russian roulette
    - Picking a specific card from a deck of card

##### Market Examples

- Failed breakouts and breakdowns: The probability of the market direction changes when a 
  breakout fails
- Reversal candles at major levels: The probability of the market direction changes when a 
  candle rejects at a zone
- Stock selloff on good earnings: Sellers took control, even though market had good earnings 
  and the probability is that the market is in favor of the bears

##### Mindset Adjustments

Probabilities in the market are **always** adjusting based on price info. Our job is to adjust
our trades with the new probabilities. **Strong opionions, loosely held.** Once the data moves
against you, you must chance your opinion.


### Math of Profitability

Expected Value (EV): Weighted average of the possible values of a variable. In our case, PnL.
- EV = Prob.(win) * reward + Prob.(loss) * risk

##### Reward to Risk Ratio (RRR)

`Reward`: Amount you make on the trade

`Risk`: Amount you risk losing on the trade

To calculate minimum winrate in order to be BE:

- 0 = P(win) * reward + P(loss) * risk
- 0 = P(win) * reward + [1 - P(win)] * risk
- P(win) = 1 / [1 + (reward / risk)] = **1 / (1 + RRR)**

View winrate chart to view how much your RRR must be to create a positive win rate.

##### Mindset Adjustments

- Backtest your system to determine its win rate and RRR
- Log your trades to see if practical win rate and RRR is the same as the backtest
- Adapt a system whose win rate will align with your personailty
