# Common Errors

### Going live too early

Using real money too soon before you have a solid understanding of the market and
a proven strategy can lead to significant losses. It's crucial to practice with a 
demo account first to get a feel for the market and test your strategies.

This could take months. If you don't put in the work, you will not make "money rain".


### Oversizing

Every trade you make could be a loser. Many things can happen when you're in a trade
and you need to be prepared to take loses. Regardless of the odds of a trade. Taking
small bets allows you to stay in the game longer and learn more.

Making big bets hoping to make easy money, you will lose all your money and will not
survive in the market. Even if your plan is perfect, you will still lose money. Never
put all of your eggs in one basket.

***DO NOT BE GREEDY***


### Sunken Cost Fallacy

After dumping lots of resources into a project, you may feel like you have to keep
going to justify the resources you've already spent. This is a fallacy. If you're 
losing money, it's better to cut your losses and move on.

Try not to get attached to a trade. If it's not working, it's not working. **Move on**.

You should never average down on a trade that is not working.


### Anchoring Effect

The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to
rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making
decisions. This can be dangerous in trading because it can lead you to hold onto a
losing position for too long.

This is commonly used in real estate to trick buyers into buying a home that is out of 
their budget by showing them a home that is worse and more expensive than the one they
want to sell before hand.

You must make decisions based on what is happening **now** not what happened in the past.
Do not be anchored to a past reference point.
