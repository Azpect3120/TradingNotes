# VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)

Shows us the price at which the average participant traded at.

Sellers become profitable when the price is below the VWAP and 
vise versa.

This can be used to determine when buyer or sellers lose control.

At the start of the day, we can place a VWAP to see who is in control.
Buying below the VWAP or selling above the VWAP can be risky.

Larger time frame VWAPs are common support zones.

### How to Use the VWAP

Intra-day VWAP is simple and the best options, large TF VWAPs
become very complex very fast.

Can be used during gaps up or down. A new VWAP should be placed
each day.

When price gaps, we can use the VWAP to determine when we should 
enter. When the price moves above the VWAP, it can indicate that
the buyers are in control.
