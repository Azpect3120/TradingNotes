# Quiz Answers

## Question 1: The price is dancing above a zone and hasn't broken bellow, what should you do?

Go long
Go short
**Do nothing**

I do not know why this is the case, but I will ask someone to explain it to me.

## Question 2: What's a trend?

A trend is a period of momentum in the price (either up or down) which is commonly supported 
by a moving average, either the 50MA or the 21MA (and im some short term cases, the 9MA).

## Question 3: Which of these is a valid box?

Base Box
50MA Box
9MA Box
**All of the above**

## Question 4: Which box breakout is the most reliable for a multi day swing?

Base box breakout
**50MA box breakout**
9MA box breakout
They're all the same

A 50 ma box is more reliable for longer swings. A 9 ma box is more for trend continuation. 
The 50 ma box shows long term momentum.

## Question 5: If you're looking for multi-day swings, what timeframe should you be using for searching setups?

Hourly
4 Hourly 
**Daily**
Weekly

I chose this because my notes say that the screener should be used to find daily swings
on the daily chart. Weekly seems too high of a timeframe for a multi-day swing.

## Question 6: What tickers should you use to gauge the overall market environment?

The tickers $QQQ and $SPY can be used to trade the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 respectively. 
They are a common indicator of the overall market environment, when they are trending up,
the market is usually in favor of an uptrend and vise versa.

## Question 7: How do you assess the strength of a specific sector in the overall market context?

On weekends, while the market is closed, the weekly charts can be analyzed to locate sectors
which are estimated to be the most profitable in the upcoming week. This can be aided by looking
at a screener and looking for patterns in the results as well as comparing the relative strength
of the sector against the S&P 500 (SPY).
